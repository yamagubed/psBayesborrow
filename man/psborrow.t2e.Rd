neighbor matching is used. Allowable options include \code{"largest"},
where matching takes place in descending order of propensity score;
\code{"smallest"}, where matching takes place in ascending order of
propensity score; \code{"random"}, where matching takes place in a random
order; \code{"data"}, where matching takes place based on the order of units
in the data. The matching order must be specified when using the nearest
neighbor matching.}

uses the commensurate prior to dynamically borrow the external control data,

scale parameter \code{scale} of half-Cauchy and half-normal distribution
respectively.}

hazard ratio.}

\description{
Simulation study is conducted to assess operating characteristics of hybrid
control design with Bayesian dynamic borrowing, where the concurrent control
is augmented by external control. The external controls are selected from
external control pool using a propensity score matching. Commensurate power
prior is used for Bayesian dynamic borrowing. The time-to-event outcome is
applicable.
}
\details{
The simulation study consists of three part: data generation
conducted by \code{trial.simulation.t2e} function, propensity score matching
conducted by \code{psmatch} function, and Bayesian analysis with commensurate
prior conducted by \code{commensurate.t2e} function. Users can specify
different sets of covariates for the propensity score matching and the
Bayesian analysis.
